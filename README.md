## Customization

Here are a few key things you should modify to make the portfolio fit your personal information and preferences:

1. **Replace the placeholder name with your real name**:

   - In the `index.html` file, find the placeholder text `Your Personal Name` and replace it with your actual name.

2. **Change the profile picture**:

   - Replace the profile picture in `assets/iconsperson.jpg` with your own photo.

3. **Add or edit projects and education**:

   - In the Projects section of `index.html`, update the **Projects** and **Education** sections with your own experiences and background.

4. Add interactivity with JavaScript (optional):
   - If you'd like to add interactive features such as animations or form validation, create a scripts.js file inside the assets/ folder and customize it to your liking.

**Note**: The `scripts.js` file is not included by default in this repository, as it depends on your specific needs, such as adding interactivity or animations. Feel free to create and customize this file based on your requirements.
